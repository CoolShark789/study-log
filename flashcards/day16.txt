"\[\text{How to represent ""n factors, choose k""?}\]"	\[\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]
\[\text{What is the formula of the Binomial Theorem?}\]	\[(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k}\]\[\text{Note: basically just counting the number of possibilities for each combination from k=0 to n}\]
\[\text{What is the form of the binomial for}\;n\in\mathbb{C}\]	\[\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)(n-k)!}{k!(n-k)!}=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!},\quad n\in\mathbb{C}\]
\[\text{What are the Maclaurin Series for}\;(1+x)^n\]	\[(1+x)^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{k}{n}x^n = 1+kx+\frac{k(k-1)}{2!}x^2 +\frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{3!}x^3 +\cdots\]
\[\text{What are consistent and inconsistent systems of linear equations?}\]	\[\text{Consistent - one or infinitely many soltuions}\]\[\text{Inconsistent - no solution}\]
\[\text{What does it mean for a matrix to be}\;m\times n\;\text{(basic)}\]	\[\text{It has m rows and n columns}\]
\[\text{What are Row Equivalent Matrices and what is their property?}\]	\[\text{Matrices that can be transformed into each other by elementary row operations}\]\[\text{They have the same solution set}\]
\[\text{What is a Span?}\]	\[\text{It is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors (plane for 2, line for 1...)}\]\[\text{Note: Basically, what you can reach by vector's linear combinations}\]
\[\text{What does it mean for a vector}\;b\;\text{to be in a Span}\;\{v_1,\cdots,v_p\}?\]	\[x_1v_1+x_2v_2+\cdots+x_pv_p=b\]\[\text{The vector}\;b\;\text{is a linear combination of the vectors in the Span}\]
\[\text{How to determine the rank of a Matrix?}\]	\[\text{After doing row reduction and creating an upper-echelone form there will be a number of pivots}\]\[\text{This number is the rank of the Matrix}\]
\[\text{What is the meaning of Matrix size in terms of dimensions?}\]	"\[\text{The number of columns indicate the input vector size (n-dimension vector for}\;m\times n)\]\[\text{The number of rows indicate the output vector size (m-dimension vector for}\;m\times n)\] \[\text{Matrix is a function which transforms inputs (vectors) according to the space transformation we ""recorded"" with unit vectors}\]"
\[\text{What is the geometrical meaning of the Matrix's Rank?}\]	\[\text{It is the dimension of the output space by Matrix A}\]\[\text{Example: n-D vector as input into}\;m\times n\;\text{Matrix with L pivots}\implies\text{m-D vector is now in L-D subspace}\]
\[\text{What is the formula to multiply Matrix by a vector? (Matrix Equation)}\]	\[Ax=\begin{bmatrix} a_1\;\;a_2\;\;\cdots\;\;a_n\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\ \vdots\\x_n\end{bmatrix}=x_1a_1+x_2a_2+\;\cdots\;+x_na_n\]\[\text{Note:}\;a_1,\;a_2,\;\cdots\;a_n\;\text{are just unit vectors changed by the space transformation}\]
\[\text{When can a matrix A reach any vector in the output space?}\]	\[\text{If it has pivot in every row - i.e. Full Rank and the columns of A span the space}\]\[\text{If the Rank is not full, then to reach b vector}\;b\;\text{it has to be inside the column space}\]
