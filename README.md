# 📘 Study Log

This repository contains my personal study log as I prepare for my first year in EE (March 2026)  
It is intended solely for my own tracking and because it kind of motivates me?..

The website displays a list of all study days and corresponding flashcards made by me with a sidebar for quick navigation between them.  
Each day lists the topics studied and short summary by topics. You can easily check the corresponding flashcards with the button at the bottom right.      
You can also view the visual representation with the Calendar in the bottom left corner as well as the "stats" in the upper right.  
The Calendar includes gradient of a green to indicate how many flashcards were added each day.
For all the books I've started there is a collection of all relevant flashcards under Authors category.  
You can use Random Flashcards to see 1-10 random flashcards from the chosen authors (if none are chosen it will take out of the whole bank).

(In case someone stumbles upon this - I have no life and have an obsession with studying, so I wouldn't recommend actually studying in that pace if you want to enjoy your free time)
