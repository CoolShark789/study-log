# ðŸ“˜ Study Log

This repository contains my personal study log as I prepare for my first year in EE (March 2026)  
It is intended solely for my own tracking and because it kind of motivates me?..

---

The website displays a list of all study days and corresponding flashcards made by me with a sidebar for quick navigation between them.  
Each day lists the topics studied and short summary by topics

(In case someone stumbles upon this - I have no life and have an obsession with studying, so I wouldn't recommend actually studying in that pace if you want to enjoy your free time)
