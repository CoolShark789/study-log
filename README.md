#Study Log

This repository contains my personal study log as I prepare for my first year in EE  
It is intended solely for my own tracking and because it kind of motivates me  

The website displays a list of all study days, with a sidebar for quick navigation between them  
Each day lists the topics studied and the date in brackets
Planning to add my flashcards at some point for future reference
