# 📘 Study Log

This repository contains my personal study log as I prepare for my first year in EE (March 2026)  
It is intended solely for my own tracking and because it kind of motivates me?..

(In case someone stumbles upon this - I have no life and have an obsession with studying, so I wouldn't recommend actually studying in that pace if you want to enjoy your free time)
