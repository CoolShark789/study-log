# ðŸ“˜ Study Log

This repository contains my personal study log as I prepare for my first year in EE (March 2026)

The website displays a list of all study days and corresponding flashcards made by me with a sidebar for quick navigation between them.  
Each day lists the topics studied and short summary by topics
